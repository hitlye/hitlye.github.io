# Scenario

There are two significant ordering methods:

* **Last In First Out(FIFO)**
* **First In First Out(LIFO)**

   <center>**Figure 1. LIFO vs FIFO**</center>

You may notice that there are also two stange nouns in the picture, **Stack** and **Queue**.  These are two abstract structure to implement these two ordering methods in computer science area.

# Stack - LIFO

Generally speaking, the Stack is a term which represents an abstract structure of LIFO. It do not give any constraint of implementation. Therefore, we can implement Stack with any data structure in any language. But **Array** and **LinkedList** are the two most common way.

In the next of this article, we will concern about some **special** parts or usages of stack.

## In Computer System

1. Core of function call, arguments and return address will be pushed into stack.
2. Local variable in Function are stored in stack.

## Two stack

## Monotone stack

# Queue - FIFO

Similiar to Stack, the Queue is also a term and the most common way to implement it are also **Array** and **LinkedList**.

## Two queue
