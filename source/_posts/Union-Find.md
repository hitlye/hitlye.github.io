# Scenario

In the following picture, it describes a scenario of **Union Find**.

**Clarifications:**

   1. Number p is connected to number q means there is a path from p to q.
   2. Pair(p, q) in the left means p and q should be connected to each other.
   3. Every time after receiving a pair(p, q), the program should connect p with q if p is not connected with q. Otherwise, ignore this pair.
